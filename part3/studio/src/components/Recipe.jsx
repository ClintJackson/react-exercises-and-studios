It's shaped into thin cakes and because of its filling nature it's usually used for sustenance on long journeys. Generally wrapped in Mallorn leaves, not much else is known about the ingredients. The bread is supposed to be brown on the outside and cream colored on the inside, sort of like a flat bread, and tastier than most other cakes in Middle-Earth. You can find a template for mallorn leaves and a alternate recipe here. These would probably make great party hors d'oeuvres if you're nerdy enough to have a LoTR themed party. Which you probably are. Dork."
